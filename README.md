# News Aggregator MERN

This project is a news aggregator backend built using the MENFX ðŸ¤¡ stack (MongoDB, Express.js, JavaFX, Node.js). It allows users to view and search for news articles from various sources.

## Requirements

To develop the News Aggregator MERN project, you will need the following:

- Node.js (version 20.12.0 or higher)
- MongoDB (version 7.0.6 or higher)
- Git

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OOPProject20232/NewsAggregator_MERN.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd NewsAggregator_MERN
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

      ```plaintext
      PORT=your-desired-port
      MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
      ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    >[!TIP] 
    > You can change in `package.json` file key `"start": "node server.js"` to `"start": "nodemon server.js` to hot reload evertime you save changes to a file.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>` (or failsafe to `http://localhost:4000`) to check if the server is running.
6. To send requests and test APIs, I recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
<br> This table links to the documentation of how to use APIs </br>
<br> Once you run step 4, you can click the link below (localhost port 4000)
